# EMBARC

EMBARC (Embeddings for Product Analysis and Review Classification) is a comprehensive framework that combines the power of BERT embeddings, autoencoders and Optuna framework to generate embeddings at different levels on textual and numerical data in the dataset for analysing product categorical prices and customer reviews. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of a regression model that helps in price prediction of a product category.


 Accurate price prediction is of utmost
importance in industries such as
e-commerce and retail, as it directly
impacts sales and profitability.
● Leveraging embedding techniques like
BERT and the Optuna, aim to create
embeddings of reviews, price, rating,
and number of ratings.
● The integration of these embeddings
into the prediction model adds as an
additional features to our use case data.
● It enhances the accuracy of our
regression model for price prediction..
● This would be useful in evaluating each
product category performance with
respect to price

Steps to Run : Download the dataset and then first generate the embeddings. After thats done run the use case.py file.
